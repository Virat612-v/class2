   <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein[a] (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955)
     was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing 
     the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions 
     to quantum mechanics.[1][5] His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2,
      which arises from special relativity, has been called "the world's most famous equation".[6] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.[7]</blockquote>
